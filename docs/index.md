The ringed seal detector is an open-source tool for detecting ringed seal barks within 
passive acoustic data. It was trained using data from the Western Canadian Arctic, and 
focuses on the 100-1200 Hz (low frequency) range. Detection outputs are compatible with 
[Raven Sound Analysis Software](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/). 

Please see the [About](About.md) and [Set Up](SetUp.md) pages to get started.
