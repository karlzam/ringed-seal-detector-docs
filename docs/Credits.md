The data collection for this detector took place in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. 
We are grateful to the Inuvialuit and Inuit for help with data collection, and for allowing 
this research to be conducted in their traditional lands. Koana, quyanainni, thank you.

The development of this detector took place in the traditional lands of the Lekwungen 
people, who we acknowledge and respect and whose historical relationships with the land 
continue to this day.
